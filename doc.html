            <p>Brooke created the Ripple application, which allows the user to create ripples on the screen. To make this, she implemented a javascript library called anime.js. <br>
                Anime.js was chosen for this application because it had the most helpful properties and functions for the ripple application. This library is used to animate <br>
                each part of the ripple group in relation to one another as one seamless animation.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Brooke also created the Weather application, which allows the user to toggle through various weather patterns. She also implemented anime.js for this application <br>
                because it's transitions suited the vision of the final product. There several differnt methods used to make these transitions. There are transitions for everything <br>
                in the window, including the sky color, and the visibility and color of the sun and cloud objects</p>
    
            <br>

            <p> Kailin created the Zen Garden application, which replicates the feel of a Zen garden. To make this, she implemented a javascript library called sketch.js. <br>
                Sketch.js was chosen because it provided the amount of user interaction that was required for this project. Sketch.js was also similar to another langauge <br>
                that we are familiar with, processing, making it a very fun library to work with.</p>
            <br>

            <p> Kailin also created our landing page, and she also wrote the content for the page. For the landing page, the holygrail wireframe from week 6 was used, although <br>
                 it was changed drastically. The button that changes the background color was referenced from the practical exam, although changed so that multiple elements are <br>
                 affected. The circles with the hover effect were referenced from Kailin's portfolio site.</p>

            <br>

            <p> Kailin also created the document page, as well as writing all of the documentation. The holygrail wireframe from week 6 was used, although, like above, it was <br>
                changed drastically. Other than that, everything else was made by hand.
