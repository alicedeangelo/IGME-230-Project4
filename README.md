# IGME-230-Project4
Brooke Daniels and Kailin Berg Final Project Proposal


# Description & Responsibilities:
  For our final project, we have decided to create a relaxation kit, which consists of three relaxing interactive animations.

The first of these animations is a pond, which will allow to user to implement ripples upon it. When clicked, the pond should ripple outwards. By using simplistic design and functions that check when the user is clicking within a specific parameter, this should not be too difficult to achieve. Brooke will be primarily in charge of this piece of the project.

The second of our animations is a Zen garden, which will allow the user to draw designs in the sand. The user will click and drag with their mouse to create patterns in the sand, with one button that will clear the garden for a fresh start. Kailin will be primarily in charge of this piece of the project.

The third of these animations is a weather simulator, which allows the user to look out of a window and select the weather that is occurring outside. There will be multiple buttons above the window, each of which will trigger a different type of weather for the user to view. Brooke will be primarily in charge of this piece of the project.
Finally, for our final webpage, Kailin will be primarily in charge of designing and creating it and Brooke will be in charge of the documentation page.

# The Tools Weâ€™ll Need:
For this project we will need to learn how to make animations that will be interactive in nature. This will mostly involve making the base animation and then planning the interactivity around it. One challenge that we will need to take into account while designing these animations is how the user interaction affects the animation itself and how we will need to balance the function and form of these projects.

The main resource we will be primarily using is the library anime.js to create the animations for this project. If we find that anime.js alone will not be enough to create the final product we envision, then we will research other possible solutions as problems arise. The anime.js documentation page will be a great resource, as well as the numerous demos and animations on websites like CodePen.
